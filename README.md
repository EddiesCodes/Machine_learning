Machine learning methods

bestSeller: This is a method to get the best Seller, which rating is know. First method is sample from two beta distributions
            and compare the results. The other method is calculate two Integrals with Monte Carlo (numeric process).
            
linear_regression: An example to train, validate and test a dataset and find the best function that fits the points.
                   We try to avoid overfitting or underfitting.
                   
bayesian_linear_regression: This is an example to sample from a posterior and plot all resulting linear models.

CIFAR_10: A implemantation of a white_resnet modul. Using keras librarys and some tools to optimize the validation accuracy.
